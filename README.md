Rules:
Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell on the grid.
Winning: The game is won if a player can get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
Draw: If all nine spaces are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw (also called a tie).
